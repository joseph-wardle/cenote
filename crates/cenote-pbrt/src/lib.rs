//! pbrt-v4 scene importer: a `.pbrt` file in, a cenote [`ChangeSet`] out.
//!
//! This crate is a *client* of cenote's public scene API — it consumes
//! nothing internal, so its existence proves the change-set surface is
//! sufficient for a real importer (the same forcing function the future
//! wire protocol needs). The pipeline is three layers, one module each:
//! `tokenize` (pbrt's four token shapes, zero-copy), `parse` (directives
//! with typed parameter lists, `Include` spliced), and `map` (pbrt's
//! graphics-state semantics lowered onto the change-set schema).
//!
//! Fidelity over coverage: the supported subset is the one the published
//! corpus actually uses, and everything outside it **warns by token
//! name** — silence never means "handled". The five semantic traps that
//! make naive importers subtly wrong — photometric light normalization,
//! `roughness`→α remapping, shorter-axis `fov`, left-handed coordinates
//! (with `ReverseOrientation`), and equal-area octahedral sky images —
//! are each handled and each pinned by a test (`map`'s module doc walks
//! through all five).
//!
//! [`ChangeSet`]: cenote::scene::changeset::ChangeSet
